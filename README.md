# Monetmaker
This application implements the work from the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf),
by L.A. Gatys, A.S. Ecker, M. Bethge (University of TÃ¼bingen, 2015).

It is a generative system based on Convolutional Neural Networks that creates new images applying the
artistic style of a painting to another picture (e.g. a photo):

<img src="https://github.com/leonardoperu/Monetmaker/blob/master/imgs/for_readme/readme1.png" width ="1024" alt="image1">

Here you can find the .py source files, along with two different .ipynb notebooks made with Google Colaboratory:
* Style_Transfer_from_content uses the content image as a basis for the generated image
* Style_Transfer_from_noise uses a random noise image as a basis for the generated image

The notebooks also contain a brief guide with the instructions to run them.

Inside the imgs/generated/transfer folder you can find many examples of pictures generated by this applications.
